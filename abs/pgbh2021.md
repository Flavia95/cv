The members of BXDs family have been inbred for 20-200 generations . They are of great value for mapping complex traits and phenome-wide association analysis. Current genomic studies on BXD assume a single linear reference genome, making it difficult to observe sequences diverging from the reference, therefore limiting the accuracy and completeness of analyses. We sequenced all extant members of all BXD families using linked-read libraries and built the pangenome graph to study genetic variation. We determined that linked reads are not ideal for pangenome building, nevertheless the pangenome enhanced the calling of complex variants not seen by traditional genomics methods and provided calls with good precision and sensitivity. As a case study we followed up a strain specific 2kb insertion that was inherited by half of the recombinant mice and correlated the genotype at this locus with clinically relevant phenotypes present in the GeneNetwork database.
